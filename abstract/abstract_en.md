## Abstract

This work proposes the thesis of the *total describability of the world*
by treating the world not in terms of meaning, value, or purpose,
but as the totality of generative motion structures.

The aim is not to construct a “theory of everything” in the explanatory sense.
Rather, by assuming that any theory, scientific description, or meaning system
emerges as a specific segmentation and fixation of motion,
this work articulates minimal descriptive conditions
under which theoretical plurality can be maintained
without resolving incommensurability.

The paper proceeds by:
(1) formalizing the conditions for treating the world as a value-neutral
    motion structure,
(2) redefining human cognition as an operation that fixes generative margin
    into meaning, and
(3) describing how cognition, theory, science, and institutions
    inevitably produce worlds as a consequence of stabilization.

No conclusion is offered.
Instead, a theoretical configuration is presented
that preserves silence, suspension, and theoretical margin
as conditions for academic dialogue.
