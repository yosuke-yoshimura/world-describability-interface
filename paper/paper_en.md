## 1. Introduction: Why Write a Non-Explanatory Theory

Academic theories are typically evaluated by
what they explain, what they take as their foundation,
and what conclusions they deliver.

In recent decades, however, as theories have become increasingly
sophisticated, a situation has emerged in which different theories
coexist without being mutually explicable.

This paper does not regard this situation as a problem of incomplete
integration or unfinished theory.

Rather, the question posed here is the following:
**Is there something already shared prior to the formation of theory itself?**

This paper treats that “something”
not as meaning, nor as being,
but as motion.

## 2. Proposition I: The Total Describability of the World

### 2.1 Statement of the Proposition

**Proposition I**

The world is, in principle, totally describable
as a structure of motion consisting of
generation, configuration, fixation, and transformation.

Here, “total describability” is used in a restricted sense.
It involves no value judgment,
does not determine semantic content,
and exhausts types of motion rather than meanings.

### 2.2 The Choice Not to Explain

This paper does not explain why the world is as it is.

Explanation presupposes an already stabilized semantic framework
through which motion is retrospectively recovered.

What is addressed here is the configuration of motion
prior to the possibility of explanation.

## 3. Proposition II: Humans and Generative Margin

### 3.1 Redefining Cognition

Humans are not entities that preserve the world as it is.

For humans, cognition is
**the operation by which generative margin is fixed into meaning.**

What is crucial here is that generative margin itself
cannot be retained.

### 3.2 Margin Is Not an Object

Generative margin is
not an observable object,
not an entity,
and not a concept.

It appears only as the possibility of difference
prior to the emergence of meaning.

## 4. Proposition III: Cognitive Structures Produce Worlds

### 4.1 The World Is Not Discovered

From the standpoint of this paper,
the world is not discovered,
nor is it constructed.

Rather, the world comes to be
as a consequence of cognitive operations.

### 4.2 Science, Theory, and Institutions

Scientific theories, philosophical systems,
institutions, and technologies
are all motion devices that
fix generative margin in specific ways
and produce stable world-images.

This paper neither rejects nor legitimizes them.

## 5. Academic Positioning: Integration Without Integration

This work is
not metaphysics,
not a revision of epistemology,
and not an integrative theory.

Yet it remains co-planar
with physics, philosophy, social theory,
and cognitive science.

This is possible because the paper demands
no foundational privilege from any theory.

## 6. Closing: Theory as Silence

No conclusion is presented.

A conclusion would constitute an operation
that closes the world.

What remains instead is a footing
for academic silence,
where description is possible
but meaning is not fully determined.
