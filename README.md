# Theoretical Configuration Interface

This repository provides an English academic text intended as an interface
for scholarly dialogue.

It does not claim to represent an original, definitive, or complete version
of any underlying work. The text is presented as a theoretical configuration
that does not aim to explain, unify, or conclude a worldview.

No ontology is established.
No theory is integrated or reduced.
No application is prescribed.

Silence, suspension, and theoretical margin are preserved as conditions
for academic dialogue.
